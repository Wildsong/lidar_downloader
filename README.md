I wrote this in about 20 minutes to download lidar data from DOGAMI.
Now I have published it to Wildsong's github so I will have to polish it up.
Improving open source, that's what pandemics are for.

I think I generated the CSV from the DOGAMI map viewer,
or I might have done it in ArcGIS Pro? Struggling to remember now.
Give me a few minutes and I'll get back to you.
